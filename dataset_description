I chose UK Gender Pay Gap 2017-2018 because this is a problem also in the US that surprisingly still happens often.
It is also not a hidden thing most pay gaps are obvious and company's find a way to continue this inequality.
I believe that women should be aware of this difference and make a conscious effort to fight for change.
I also chose this dataset because I think more people should be aware and care about the effect the gender pay gap has on women.
Effects such as discouraging women from pursuing certain careers, fields of study, and passions in life.
